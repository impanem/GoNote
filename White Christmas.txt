I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
Just like the ones I used to know.

Where the treetops glisten,
and children listen,
to hear sleigh bells in the snow.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
With every Christmas card I write.

May your days be Merry and Bright.

And may all, your Christmases, be white...
