## Installation
1. Create an `addons` folder in your project.
2. 2a: Create a `GoNote` folder inside `addons`. 2b: Or, instead of 2a, if you downloaded the .zip from this git, move the `GoNote-main` folder from the .zip file into your `addons` folder, **and delete the *-main* part of *GoNote-main* filename! This *-main* will cause issues!!!**
3. Copy all of the files from this git into the `GoNote` folder (if you didn't do the 2b method).
4. Enable GoNote in `Project Settings > Plugins`.
5. **RESTART YOUR ENGINE.**

This is how your addons folder should look:
```
res://
    addons
        GoNote
```

**Remember, if you downloaded the .zip from git, and your file says `GoNote-main`, you need to delete the *-main* part of the filename. Otherwise, issues will occur, and the plugin won't work!**


Thank you for installing!
